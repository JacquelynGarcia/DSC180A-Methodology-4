## **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we are currently covering is the use of chain of thought reasoning and API prompting with function calling. I find it incredibly interesting how prompting strategies can be used to guide models to produce reasoning steps. Additionally, function calling can employ LLMs into modular components within larger systems like through the use of Agents. I've enjoyed these topics because they take theoretical ideas in model reasoning and pair it with engineering approaches. While these subjects are relatively new to me, I look forward to extending my research and usage into my Quarter 2 Project.

## **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation that I would like to pursue for Quarter 2 is building an agentic AI systems to detect missing context in articles. Many forms of misinformation are not completely false, they are often missing key details, selectively framed, or incomplete. I want to explore whether an agentic LLM can identify where important context is absent, retrieve the missing information, and generate an augmented explanation. This project would combine RAG, chain of thought prompting, and multi-step planning to create a system that improves the quality of information presented to users.

## **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would make to my Quarter 1 approach is dedicating more time early on to reading research and information on existing methodologies before committing to a final pipeline design. Since I plan to build an agentic system for detecting missing context and I have never built an agent before I believe that having a stronger theoretical foundation will make a huge difference. If I had adopted this mindset earlier in Quarter 1, I would have been more intentional about understanding the prior work. I plan to proactively read research so that I can begin Quarter 2 with a stronger foundation.

## **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
For this project, I would be interested in experimenting with retrieval-augmented generation for gathering missing evidence, entity linking or knowledge graph expansion to trace relationships between claims, and multi-agent debate mechanisms to compare competing interpretations of the same event.
